In order to do a useful evaluation, we need to ensure that:
a) tests can easily run agnostic to whether ipcd is installed
b) the performance environments are basically identical
c) we can extract data so we can, say, do a qq-plot and do normality

I don't think I have time for analyzing excellence of benchmarks.
